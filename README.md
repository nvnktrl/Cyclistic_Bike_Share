# Cyclistic_Bike_Share

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I have performed many real-world tasks, worked for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and met different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, I had followed the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

In this Case study, I have Performed Data Processing and Data Cleaning to analyze the data and gain insights to maximize the number of annual memberships by converting casual riders to annual members from the past 12 months of Trip Data of a fictional company Cyclistic.
